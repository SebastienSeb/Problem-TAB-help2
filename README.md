# Problem-TAB-help2
Hello, I have a recent problem with Simple TAB Group (I love this app). Since +- 10 days, tabs on groups leaves this group when I click on it. They are opened in a new group (the last I created). I cannot have groups with tabs I decide to organize cause there tabs automaticly leaves the right group to go to the wrong group. Thankx
